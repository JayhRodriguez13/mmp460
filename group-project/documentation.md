title: Documentation/User guide to updating the site

Write a user guide explaining how to update the site. Assume familiarity with WordPress management in the dashboard but no HTML/CSS knowledge.

Your guide should explain how to update the content in the different pages. For example: how to update the slideshow, what should be the image size of the slides, how to update the text in the homepage columns, etc.

In addition, include information of HTML colors and fonts used in the site.
