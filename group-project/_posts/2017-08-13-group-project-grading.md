title: Group Project grading

All group members are equally responsible for all parts of the web design, programming and production. 

Project grade will be determined as followed:

- Group grade 70%
- Individual grade 30%

Group grade is based on the following:

- 40% Completion of all pages, with all content, as outlined in the sample site by the last day of class (5/17). Submission of documentation by our last meeting (5/22 or 5/24).
- 30% Design – quality and effectiveness of design, and its relevance to client stated needs and goals. Responsiveness to critique and client’s requests for changes within a reasonable time frame.
- 30% HTML/CSS code and WordPress theme work. Customizing the starter theme underscore to meet project requirements. All HTML/CSS code must validate free of errors.

Individual Grade is based on amount and quality of contribution, ability to work well in a team, as well as your teammates’ evaluations.

You will have a chance to let me know what you have done for the project as well as what you think about your teammates contribution.

Final grade is only determined by the instructor and is not influenced by client selection of site. However being responsive to client requests for reasonable changes (as determined by the instructor) is part of the grade and an important part of this project’s learning experience.
