Design a responsive website that will introduce yourself and your work to potential employers.

Your website must include the following items:

- A showcase of your multimedia and art projects done in BMCC and elsewhere. You can include other types of assignments, such as an essay, if relevant to your future job search.
- A description or explanation of each work.
- A paragraph introducing yourself and summarizing your professional goals
- Your resume
- Your contact information

### The work process ###

**Planning and Content Development**

1. **Consider the following questions**
  - What are your immediate professional goals? In other words, what kind of job or assignment do you hope this website will help you get?
  - How will you introduce yourself professionally? a web designer? a programmer? a graphic designer?
  - How many projects do you have to show? How many of them will you include in the portfolio?

2. **Organize your site’s content**
  - Select the work that you would like to showcase in the portfolio.
  - Decide how to organize your work on the site. For example, by type (websites, print, paintings, drawings etc.), by skill (design, development), by software (Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash) or as case studies.
  - Decide how to organize the site’s content. For example, what content you will have on the homepage? where will be your contact information? (in a separate page? on the homepage? on every page?)
  - Write down links’s labels and the titles of the pages.
  - Draw a sitemap (in a flowchart format) that shows your site’s organization.

3. **Write**
  - your resume, if you haven’t done it already.
  - a paragraph introducing yourself and your professional goals.
  - a short description for each of the projects in your portfolio.
  
**Design the interface**
In Photoshop, mockup the design for the homepage and gallery page for desktop and mobile. f

**HTML/CSS**
Use standard-compliant, semantic html5 code + CSS. Test your site in multiple browsers.

### Grading Guidelines ###

Your grade will be based on:

- Quality of code: your site must have error-free, standard-compliant, semantic HTML and CSS. Validate your code!
- Creativity: your portfolio may be the first impression that you make on a prospective employer. Find creative ways to assert your skills.
- Organization: the way you organize your work should help your target audience find it!
- Writing must be clear, professional and free of errors.
