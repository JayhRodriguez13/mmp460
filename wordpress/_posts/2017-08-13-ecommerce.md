Several plugins allow adding a store functionality to a WordPress site without back end coding. The following two plugins are popular and well supported:

[wooCommerce](https://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/) is a great WP plugin that makes it very easy to integrate a full store in a WP site, complete with product pages, shopping cart and checkout.

If you just need a shopping cart that links to PayPal WordPress [Simple Paypal Shopping Cart](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-simple-paypal-shopping-cart/) plugin is lightweight and easy to use. It allows you to add an ‘Add to Cart’ button for your product on any posts or pages.
